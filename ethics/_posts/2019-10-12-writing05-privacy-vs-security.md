### Where do you draw the line between individual privacy and national security? In a democracy, which one is paramount?


After the readings and videos for this week, I can't simply dismiss all the
stories I hear as conspiracy theories and nothing more. Thinking about these
issues often instills fear for a variety of reasons. I think wholistically
national security is more paramount truly 'safe' democracy, but I recognize
that these fears must be addressed as barriers public trust and acceptance,
and as the basis for restrictions of acceptable use:
1. **Abuse of power / intentional malicious intent**

For me, the scariest articles we read were those on the abuse of power. It's
hard to trust agencies with extensive histories of such abuse either
personally (the FBI girlfriend spying incident) or at an organizational level
(as revealed by the Snowden leaks). In order to gain our trust, the
government needs to strongly reprimand such abuses of power, and should
invest more 'security' to prevent such activities from happening in the
first place.

2. **Potential of leaks and being hacked**

The government may have good intentions in wanting personal 'backdoor'
access to information, but that's only half the story. If a backdoor exists,
there is no 100% guarantee it won't eventually fall into the wrong hands,
either through leaks or through independent hacking. As long as this
possibility exists, there will always be inherent risks to these kinds of
endeavors. I'm not sure what the best solution to this problem is, but I don't
think the possibility should be completely ignored, as it often is in government
addresses on security issues.

3. **Morally ambiguous/immoral laws**

As mentioned before, national security involves a huge amount of trust in our
government, which includes laws passed regarding security. As citizens, we must
ensure that laws passed adhere to our moral codes, or else we should stick up
for our beliefs. This is especially true when it comes to security. Good moral
laws (should hopefully) lead to a stronger trust in our government.

4. **Institutionalized discrimination and racism**

Institutionalized racism is a hot topic in modern politics. Security done wrong
enables the automation of such discrimination. As a safeguard, I think there
should be more formalized legal procedures around security, such as the ability
to 'appeal' security issues. The issue that was brought up in class of the black
activist group being classified as a terrorist group is unsettling, and needs
to be addressed on all levels before security can be used safely and
effectively.

5. **Being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people**

On a personal level, security cases have proved that your 'digital self image'
is often beyond your control. This is evident in the story of the Harvard student
who was kicked out of the country because of his *friends'* social media posts.
This raises fear of being caught even if I don't personally think I have
anything to hide. I think this kind of far-reaching evidence should not be
allowed in making large scale legal decisions. Maybe it can be used in the
initial process of gathering intelligence, but ultimately should be used to
incriminate someone unless they have personally committed a crime.

6. **Being punished for 'non-illegal' activites**

Sometimes we want to hide information for various reasons. For example mayor
Pete Buttigieg hid the fact that he's gay for many years. Had this information
leaked before he decided to share, his career could have quickly taken a turn
for the worse. Even if this information is never leaked, knowing that the
government knows non-public information about you is unnerving.
