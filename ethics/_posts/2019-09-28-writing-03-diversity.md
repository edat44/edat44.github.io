### How should the computing and technology community work towards creating a welcoming, diverse, and inclusive community? Is this a moral imperative or a laudable goal or unlikely wish? 

I will admit that as a white man I don't have many first hand experiences of
feeling excluded or ostracized because of my identity. Almost anywhere I go in
the tech world I find people who look, think, and talk like me. While I've felt
very welcome and included from my experiences, I'm starting to become more aware
of my peers around me who don't feel the same way. To me diversity isn't about
static calculated statistics and numbers; its about people. Diversity means
allowing a diverse group of people from distinct backgrounds to all feel
comfortable together. In the tech industry, this means not treating people
differently or overly changing expectations just because of some part of their identity.

I think there are two conflicting goals that need to somehow be balanced to
fully address this issue. We must learn to be aware of the social situation with
respect to diversity, while not letting these factors overly affect our
decisions. Either of these ideologies, however, if taken to the extreme, can be
extremely harmful.

With only a strong focus on understanding the social situation with respect to diversity:
1. Professor Bui's example of sorting potential candidates into groups based
   solely on their identity really hit me as an example of good intentions gone
   wrong. On paper the department was being proactive in trying to increase
   diversity, but in reality they were simply continuing to discrimnate against certain
   group of people is a more 'legal' manner. This removes the meritocraticness of the system
   by placing higher emphasis on identity rather than pure ability. It also in some ways dehumanizes
   those groups: In Professor Bui's example the process structure implied that
   those minority groups couldn't be a part of the 'best candidate' pool.
2. In a large group of diverse people from different backgrounds, some of the
   nuance of different individual cultures and identities is lost. One of the
   discussions in class this week surrounding conferences like Grace Hopper was the ability for
   people at these conference to simply be themselves for a period of time. Because of this desire to
   be around similar people who share your background,
   I doubt a 'perfectly diverse' group of people would 'fix' these underlying
   diversity issues.<sup>1</sup>

On the other hand if these factors are completely ignored, there are at least two possible
negative outcomes:
1. The cycle of privilege is allowed to propagate. In a strictly meritocratic
   system, those without the initial resources will be at a potentially perpetual
   disadvantage, through no fault of their own other than their identity.
2. There are certain legitimate circumstances where different groups have
   different needs. The biggest example is pregnant and nursing women. This is a very important
   time in a woman's life, and is important for a functioning society. Special
   considerations must be taken to ensure women are able to take of their child
   properly. In cases like this, caring for the individual is more important that
   treating everyone as 100% equal. That's not at all to say women should be
   treated as less; on the contrary, they should be treated with even more
   respect for all the difficulties they have to go through that men could never
   being to comprehend.


As seen above, there are dangers to both sides of this diversity issues. I think
we should all strive to at least be aware of both sides of this issue, and make
a conscious effort to respect the human dignity of every person. If that's too
much to ask for, you should really take a deep look at your priorities..
