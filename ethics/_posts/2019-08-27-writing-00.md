### What does it mean to be an ethically responsible person and is that something you strive for?

Growing up my in a Christian household, 'ethics' has always been explicitly tied
to the Bible and the teaching of the Methodist Church. On top of this my mom
approaches most problems with a 'God is Love' mindset, meaning she is always
thinking about how to best love those around her in every situation. My introductory
philosophy class at Notre Dame was my first real exposure to other concrete
ethical frameworks. From that class I began to form my own personal ethical
beliefs:
1. My Christian faith is still a strong part of who I am, and the more I read
   the Bible the more I am awestruck by the profound truth of Christ's words.
   
2. In particular I've come to appreciate my mom's 'God is Love' philosophy. It is amazing
   how powerful acts are truly performed out of love, and it is humbling how
   often I mess this up.

3. In my philosophy class I was quite intrigued by Aristotle's **Virtue Ethics**.
   While his framework may struggle with addressing individual actions, I believe it has
   great merit in building up one's character, and provides a solid foundation for thinking
   about ethical lifestyle choices beyond any single action, where the effects are too far
   reaching to be helpful to **Utilitarianism** and too abstract to be useful to
   non-consequentialist theories like **Kantianism** or the **Rights Approach**.


I am by no means perfect at following through with my beliefs, but I do strongly
believe that for me the best ethical framework is a combination of the above points:
I want to use my knowledge about God and has amazing love as springboard for building up my
character and becoming the best person I can be. 

This week's discussion really brought to light a personal issue I've been
dealing with for quite a while now. While so many people around me seem to have
something they're passionate about, and desire to use computer science to
fulfill their passions, I am the opposite: I am passionate about _computer
science itself_, and don't really have any lofty dreams or ambitions. Some
interpretations of the Parable of the Talents would argue this is not a valid
use of my skills, especially since next year I will be working at a trading firm
who's sole goal in writing software is to make more money for the stakeholders
and employees of the company. This is definitely _not_ using software to "help
people become the best version of themselves" (Jeff Atwood)
