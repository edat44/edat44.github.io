### What does it mean to be an ethically responsible person and is that something you strive for?

Growing up my in a Christian household, 'ethics' has always been explicitly tied
to the Bible and the teaching of the Methodist Church. On top of this my mom
approaches most problems with a 'God is Love' mindset, meaning she is always
thinking about how to best love those around her in every situation. My introductory
philosophy class at Notre Dame was my first real exposure to other concrete
ethical frameworks. From that class I began to form my own personal ethical
beliefs:
1. My Christian faith is still a strong part of who I am, and the more I read
   the Bible the more I am awestruck by the profound truth of Christ's words.
   
2. In particular I've come to appreciate my mom's 'God is Love' philosophy. It is amazing
   how powerful acts are truly performed out of love, and it is humbling how
   often I mess this up.

3. In my philosophy class I was quite intrigued by Aristotle's **Virtue Ethics**.
   While his framework may struggle with addressing individual actions, I believe it has
   great merit in building up one's character, and provides a solid foundation for thinking
   about ethical lifestyle choices beyond any single action, where the effects are too far
   reaching to be helpful to **Utilitarianism** and too abstract to be useful to
   non-consequentialist theories like **Kantianism** or the **Rights Approach**.
   
   After some of the comments made in class this week, I am starting to think Aristotle's
   idea of virtues can be taken even further if applied to one's technical
   skills. Not only should I work on becoming the best person I can be, but I
   should continue to build up my skills to the best of my ability.

I am by no means perfect at following through with my beliefs, but I do strongly
believe that for me the best ethical framework is a combination of the above points:
I want to use my knowledge about God and has amazing love as springboard for building up my
character and becoming the best person I can be. 

This week's discussion really brought to light a personal issue I've been
dealing with for quite a while now. While so many people around me seem to have
something they're passionate about, and desire to use computer science to
fulfill their passions, I am the opposite: I am passionate about _computer
science itself_, and don't really have any lofty dreams or ambitions. Some
interpretations of the Parable of the Talents would argue this is not a valid
use of my skills, especially since next year I will be working at a trading firm
whose sole goal in writing software is to make more money for the stakeholders
and employees of the company. This is definitely _not_ using software to "help
people become the best version of themselves" (Jeff Atwood). At the same time, I
really enjoyed the work I did this summer, the company took care of me, and they
are compensating me handsomely.

These discussions brought up some very deep questions: Is it 'unethical' to choose
a job on the basic of pay, even if my intent is to pay off my student debt as quickly
as possible, or because _I_ get to live a comfortable lifestyle? Does it make me a 'bad person'
to believe these things are okay? 

Professor Bui's discussion of the
Catholic call to become **Priests, Prophets, and Kings** really helped me answer
these questions. The idea that every
choice we make matters, and we don't necessarily need to drop everything and
change our entire lifestyle to make a difference stuck with me. Combining this idea with
my new set of ethical frameworks I've been
developing, I believe my actions are at least **ethically permissible**, because
1. I am still able to develop my character and hone my technical skills
2. My career and job choice does not define who I am, and does not prevent  me from reaching out
and loving both my coworkers and those outside the workplace.

No matter what I end up doing with my life, I believe the best thing I can do to
be an ethically responsible person is to stick to my ethical values I've
developed here at Notre Dame, and continue to keep God's love at the center of
everything I do.
