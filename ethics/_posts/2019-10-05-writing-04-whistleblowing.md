### According to **Roger Boisjoly**, "[whistleblowing] destroyed [his] career, [his] life, everything else." What good, then, is **whistleblowing**?

For me, engineering is more than just the sum of technical practices and
managerial leadership. 'Good' engineering firms utilize both parts for the common good
of their clients. Engineering failures can come in many forms and are often
layered, with smaller failures snowballing into larger ones. In the Therac-25
incident, there were a few red flags (at least in hindsight) that eventually
enabled the machine failures. While no one individual is at fault, we can learn
from the past to ensure similar red flags are caught earlier before bubbling
over into a real disaster. The biggest example is pushing a new model of a
product as simply a 'new and improved' version of an older product. Both the
Therac-25 and Boeing 737 Max disasters were caused because of this mislabeling.
It is the duty first and foremost of engineers to be fully aware of all changes
they make, and to be on the lookout for any and all ramification of their design
changes. Next the product managers and leadership have a responsibility to
advertise the new product as its own independent entity, even if it means taking
a hit to the bottom line. As seen from the mentioned disasters above, stretching
the truth, even unknowingly, is not worth the possible risks, especially with
these larger systems where failure can result in loss of human life.

To formally analyze whistleblowing, two different ethics frameworks should be
used in tandem: Aristotle's virtue ethics, and consequentialist ethics
such as Utilitarianism or The Common Good Approach. Both are important in considering the
morality of whistleblowing. The first focuses on motivations behind the act,
while the second is cognizant of possible consequences and its effects on
different groups of people.
1. Even though motivation behind
   information leaks, especially in matters of National Security, has no legal
   binding, it is still important to consider from a moral standpoint. Leaks should
   not be done without good cause, which aligns with the Catholic Church catechism
   teaching on this issue. To go a step further, I believe this motivation should stem
   from a violation of some well-formed legal or moral principles. Personal revenge
   or saying "it didn't feel right" are not valid reasons to justify a such momentous
   act as whistleblowing. From my reading of the Roger Boisjoly case,
   it seems like Boisjoly was (at least partially) motivated by a desire to clear his own
   conscious and shift the blame off of himself. If this is indeed the
   case,<sup>1</sup> I have trouble fully justifying Boisjoly's decision, even
   if he had other good intentions mixed in. 
2. Although whistleblowers have no way to see the full effect of this actions,
   they should minimally consider different possible affected groups, and weigh
   the best-case benefit against the worst-case loss. In instances of national
   security, this often involves thinking about potential threats to the
   American public or members of the armed forces if the leaked information were
   to be analyzed by any enemies of the state. Sometimes these effects are not
   as obvious: for example Roger Boisjoly's leak and full cooperation with the investigation
   caused great harm to his company, even though a majority of his colleagues
   had no direct hand in the Challenger incident.
