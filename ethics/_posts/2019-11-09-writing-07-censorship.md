### What are the limits of **freedom of speech** on the Internet? Is **online censorship** a desirable good, a necessary evil, or a bad idea be avoided?

Full freedom of speech is a double edged sword. On the plus side, it protects a
nation's citizens from an abusive government, and in that sense can even curb
government corruption. On the negative side, it enables people to say things
beyond the scope of 'proper speech', including hate speech, misinformation,
and sometimes even pure lies. The Internet proliferates both sides of the debate
because of

1. The ease of creating new uncensored content
2. The ease of accessing near infinite information from a variety of sources
3. The speed at which information travels across the globe once posted
4. The permanence of any information posted on the Internet. 

Point **1** gives everyone and anyone a chance to share their opinion,
regardless of whether or not it should be shared or provides any social good.
For me, content that promotes or incites hate or violence<sup>1</sup> does not
provide social good, and should be censored. Point **2** furthers this issue by
allowed vulnerable individuals to access this dangerous content. Many of the
people behind recent mass shootings were influenced in some way by hateful
online content, such as the El Paso shooting massacre manifesto posted on
**8chan**. Points **3** and **4** are also troubling, especially in the context
of misinformation. Whether malicious or accidental, misinformation often spreads
out of control like a wildfire. In the age of **Fake News**, it is often hard to
discern the ground truth with all the extraneous information floating around. In
addition to censoring excessively hateful content, I believe some sort of fact
checking system should exist, which is why I side with Twitter's decision to block
political ads completely, over Facebook who refuses to do any scanning for
factual correctness in political ads.

In terms of who is responsible for monitoring and censoring content, I was
struck by the large amount of players involved in the process of generating
and displaying Internet content discussed in the Cloudflare article<sup>2</sup>

As the article asks, who is responsible for censoring content? 
The most obvious example talked is probably the **Platform** itself, such as
Facebook or Wordpress, but as the Cloudflare article makes clear, any
of those entities could decide to block content of their own choosing.
Even my firefox browser *could* chose to block or modify incoming content before
it renders it. Lastly, the government could choose to enforce censorship at any of
these levels, such as the example talked about in class of
search engines in China modifying search results to suit the government's
desires. 

In practice, I understand that deciding to actual censor content is a slippery
slope. I believe companies should be allowed to block content that goes against
their beliefs, as long as these beliefs are made publicly available, are clearly
articulated, and are consistent across different decisions. This rule does
**not** apply to decisions based purely from a business perspective. For me,
these beliefs only extend into the ethical (or maybe political) realms, **not**
the business world. Companies are allowed to have whatever (legal) business
practices they want, but these practices should not drive their censorship
model.
