### If corporations are afforded the same rights as individual persons, should they also be expected to have the same ethical and moral obligations and responsibilities? Who (if anyone) or what (if anything) should enforce fair play and competition between corporations?

From our discussions this week, to me the heart of this issue of the corporate
conscience stems from an inability to determine how far personal rights extend
to corporations. Some corporate freedoms have been legally affirmed such as
the freedom of religion in the landmark Burwell vs Hobby Lobby case, or
freedom of speech in the Citizens United vs FEC case. In other areas, however,
corporations are treated much much differently, such as the inability of a
corporation to 'go to jail'. This amounts to corporations being allowed to pick
and choose the best parts of 'being a person' while ignoring all the negative
consequences. The consumerist article points out many of these nuances. This is
in many ways unethical, especially if it enables corporations to perform actions
that would be 'illegal' if performed by an individual.

Most companies are built (at least originally) around a consumer desire or need. During
initial company growth, focus is usually on developing a viable marketable product. After
entering the market, however, many companies lose sight of what the
consumer wants in favor of reasserting corporate dominance in the market. This
trend becomes even worse when corporations expand into parallel markets, such as
Google and Microsoft have done within the past few decades. With all the
products Google offers, they were/are incentivized to promote their own products
first in their searches, even if the other products aren't directly applicable
to the search or the consumer. This is very similar to an affluent individual
such as Elon Musk investing in ten thousand different companies, and having them
all promote each other's business endeavors. To me this is also unethical, as it
is overly abusing personal success for the role purpose of personal gain.

I think Google should be split up. In order to create and foster the best
possible search engine, it should be split off from Google so it can devote its
full resources and research towards its goal, and will be more likely to
prioritize consumers over other Google business sectors. Just as the government
humans a role in officiating individual morality (at least to some extend)
through laws and law enforcement, so too should it play a role in keeping
corporations in checks. This involves both creating laws and regulations to
guide corporation actions and behaviors, as well as enforcing these rules and
regulations in a meaningful way.

Who decides what is 'right' and 'wrong'? I believe it should be a combination of
the common people, the government, and corporations. In the end, it is people
who are affected by corporation and government decisions. If everyone decides
they desire convenience and are okay with Google promoting their own material,
then maybe it should be allowed after all. There are, however, instances where
what the people want isn't always realistic or practical. Take socialism or
communism for example. Although the theory sounds good in many ways, history has
shown it as an idealistic project impossible to physically implement. In the
same way, corporations and the government should have (some) weight on these big
decisions.
