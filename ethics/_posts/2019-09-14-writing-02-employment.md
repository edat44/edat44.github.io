    - My high school internships developed in this manner. I never actually
      'applied' for a position, I just kinda showed up and they gave me various
      work to do. This atmosphere was definitely reflective of their status as a
      new small startup. I can't imagine this happening at Google.

### What is your overall impression of the hiring process in your chosen industry? Is it efficient? Is it effective? Is it ethical?

I've been very fortunate to have a primarily positive experience with the hiring
process. My first two internships in high school materialized through
connections: the first through a friend's mom who happened to be the CEO of a
company at Innovation Park, and the second through a professional connection I
made during my first internship. While these internships were by no means my
dream jobs, they were at least concrete real-world experiences and resume
boosters.

In college, I received all of my internships through the normal application
process. Because so much worth and value is attached to these internships (at
least among my CS friends), it was a pretty disheartening experience to apply to
30+ internships and only receive 8 interviews and 3 official offers.<sup>1</sup> It made me
wonder why I was good enough for some companies and not others. Was my technical
skillset just not a 'good fit', as all the rejection
emails said? Or was I lacking the core soft skills needed to sell myself? Or
worse did I simply apply at the wrong time and catch the recruiter on a bad day?
Receiving a solid offer in the late Fall alleviated some of these pressures,
since I knew *at least one company wanted me*.

Because of this over-dependence (and many other reasons), many people claim
that the entire hiring process is broken. I can attest that while I was inside
the process it certainly *felt* like everything was broken. However after talking with
the HR team at Akuna (where I worked this summer) and seeing their struggles to
attract and retain high-quality talent in today's increasingly mobile modern job market,
I realized that there just isn't one fix-all solution to the problem.
The job market is all about striking a deal between worker and company that is agreeable 
to both parties, who both have their own (often conflicting) self-interests to attend to.
From this, I've come to believe that you can learn a great deal about a company by their approach to hiring:
if they utilize super difficult technical coding interview questions, they
probably highly value technical skills or raw talent. But if they focus more on behavioral
interviews, they probably value soft skills more highly. At Akuna, the interview
process consisted of talking through a series
of theoretical network design questions, where I came up with and talked through
a possible design, including a justification for my decisions. After working at Akuna  this summer,
this focus on design-centric problem solving reflects their day-to-day
work culture. The hiring process
is often your first glimpse into a company's values and expectations and should
be thought of as such, instead of a mundane and superfluous mental exercise. 

As we talked about in class, many different factors come into
play during the interview process. From my experience, connections can be a
great asset in expediting the whole process or creating new opportunities out of
thin air,<sup>2</sup> but are not strictly always strictly necessary. In line
with what I said earlier, I believe the exact rating of what's important depends
on the company and what they value most. Part of the process is finding out what
*you* value, and finding companies that align with *your* convictions.
This starts even before the interview and continues for as long as you work for
them. Part of the reason I like my job at Akuna so much is that we both have the
same underlying desire to engineer clean, modern software, even if it takes
extra time to get it right.
